# Rainbow attack on SHA256

This program in C++ allows you to generate a rainbow table and crack passwords hashed in SHA256.

For academic reasons :
- passwords are NOT salted;
- passwords are stored after a single pass through the hash function;
- passwords are alphanumeric (lowercase, uppercase and number);
- passwords have at least 6 and at most 10 characters.

## Fetching from GitLab
To fetch the project from GitLab, run the following command :
```
$ git clone https://gitlab.com/maluyckx/ssd_ws_rainbow.git
```

## Building the Project
We have provided a makefile that simplifies the build process. Move into the correct directory and use the `make` command :
```
$ cd code
$ make rainbow
```
## Usage
You can use the program in three different ways : 
1) Generate a rainbow table depending on parameters (Generate)
2) Trying to find passwords from their hashes using a rainbow table (Attack)
3) Both (Both)

### 1) Generate
To generate a rainbow table, use the following command :
```shell
./rainbow G <n> <l> <rt>
```
where :
- `<n>` = the number of passwords that you want to generate
- `<l>` = the length of these passwords (we recommend between 6 and 10)
- `<rt>` = name of the file where the output rainbow table should be stored (recommend using a .rt)

### 2) Attack
To perform an attack on hashes using a rainbow table, use the following command :
```shell
./rainbow A <rt> <hashes>
```
where :
- `<rt>` = a binary file generated by the command above ("pwds.rt")
- `<hashes>` = a plaintext file containing one hash on each line

### 3) Both
To perform both operations, use the following command :
```shell
./rainbow B <n> <l> <hashes>
```
where :
- `<n>` = the number of passwords that you want to generate
- `<l>` = the length of these passwords (we recommend between 6 and 10)
- `<hashes>` = a plaintext file containing one hash on each line


## Useful informations

**Generation**

The generation times for various password lengths with 50,000 passes are as follows :

| Length | Time (sec)|
|------------------------------------|----------|
| 10 000                             |   55.704s |
| 100 000                            |   552.988s  |         
| 500 000                            |   2796.256s |         
| 1 000 000                          |   5687.98s | 

The length of the passwords does not significantly affect the generation time.

### Recommended table lengths (using Birthday problem)
Recommendations as to the number of rows to have in the rainbow tables to have optimal chances to crack passwords
(can't guarantee it'll be on time with the generation requirements though).  

|             Table length             | 6       | 7         | 8          | 9           | 10                                                         |
|:------------------------------------:|---------|-----------|------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recommended number <br/>of passwords | 300.000 | 2.100.000 | 15.500.000 | 120.000.000 | 920.000.000<br/>(probably too long for our implementation) |
| Approximate odds | 50%     | 50%       | 50%        | 50%         | 50%                                                        |
